# Interpolate is a library for generic linear interpolation objects. Useful for
# such things as calculating linear motion between locations (or arrays of
# locations), multi-channel color gradients, piecewise functions, or even just
# placing values within intervals.
#
# Interpolation generators can be created with the Interpolate::Points class,
# given a set of interpolation "key points" and associated key values. By
# default, the key values should be able to calculate their own blending
# function (by defining an +interpolate+ instance method). Alternatively, the
# Interpolate::Points object can be passed a block that takes three arguments:
# the lower value, the higher value, and the balance ratio between the two.
#
# For the balance ratio, 0.0 means 100% of the lower value and a balance ratio
# of 1.0 means 100% of the higher value. A balance ratio of 0.5 means that the
# Interpolate::Points object has determined that the interpolated value should
# be a 50%/50% mixture of the lower and higher values.  It is up to the blending
# function to determine how to calculate the interpolated value.
#
# A Interpolate::Points objects is constructed with a Hash object, wherein each
# key is a Numeric and each value is an object (which itself may respond to
# +interpolate+). If any of the value objects do not respond to +interpolate+, a
# blending function (+blend_with+) must be used to determine the interpolated
# values.
#
# The default blending function, Interpolate::Points::DEFAULT_BLEND, simply
# calls the +interpolate+ method on the lower key value with the arguments of 1)
# the higher key value and 2) the balance ratio.
